# SapFlowMeter

If you haven't already, start by setting up [Loom for Arduino](https://github.com/OPEnSLab-OSU/Loom/blob/master/README.md).


A sap flow meter measures the velocity of the sap in a tree. This is a useful indicator of the tree's health, and can provide valuable feedback for irrigation and disease management.

Our meter here uses the Heat Ratio Method, where it applies a heat pulse into the sapwood, and measures the temperature of the sapwood both above and below the heater.

We'll include schematics and detailed instructions soon.
